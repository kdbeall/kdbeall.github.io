title: Draft Post - Why Language Server Index Format (LSIF) is extremely powerful
---

Most code is read and not written. As Uncle Bob Martin says, "the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. 
We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code."


### Parsing Tidbits
The truth is that building parsers is often perceived as an expensive process. In the rush to create language servers often it is common to use the parser from the compiler. However, compilers are typically built without a regard for incremental approaches and without the robustness needed for advanced IDE work. A compiler simply has to check if the code is in or not in the language. An IDE tool needs to keep on chugging even if the program is incorrect.

More modern tools like [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) exist are arguably the bleeding edge of parser generators.

Why LSIF then? As mentioned earlier, most of a developer's time is spent reading code and not writing it.
