title: Draft Post - The Guided Evolution Probe
---

A common trope in science fiction of colonization is that of the sleeper ship. Drifting through interstellar space, 
Captain Kirk and the gang stumble upon one such vessel. Perhaps the occupants are preserved cryogenically or in some type of suspended animation pod 
— an episode of grappling with a superhuman dictator.

An arguably more practical concept is embryo space colonization. Instead of sending adult humans in some kind of suspended animation contraption, it is sufficient to send human embryos. On arrival at a suitable planet, the probe will gestate the embryos in an artificial womb and then raise the children. However, what constitutes a 'suitable planet'? The planet the embryos are sent to could be ultimately deeply unsuitable for humans. I posit that the ideal ecosystems for humans to thrive could take millions of years to produce. Thus, I think it is pertinent to borrow from the idea of directed panspermia — the concept of seeding planets in other star systems with bacteria. Perhaps even eukaryote microorganisms could kickstart the ecosystem needed for humans to thrive.

No speculative approaches such as self-replicating von Neumann probes, mind uploading, or warp drives are necessary. Colonization of our galaxy can be achievable with technology feasible within our lifetimes.

Let's take that idea of directed panspermia a step further. Can we direct the evolution of organisms on the colonized planet? I propose a probe which seeds suitable exosolar planets with microbes. It then modifies those organisms using viruses as germline gene transfer agents. It acts as a repeated gene driver — an application of genetic engineering to spread a particular group of genes throughout a population.

It could take upwards of 30,000 years to reach the TRAPPIST system


## Terraforming and Guided Evolutionary Process

1. The probe, likely powered by solar sails, is launched from Earth.
2. It sails to other star systems over thousands of years in search of suitable planets.
3. If a suitable planet is found, the probe will seed the planet with baseline extremophile bacteria.
4. The probe will detect when the planet is sufficiently terraformed, e.g., it has appropriate atmospheric composition and temperature.
5. The probe will seed the planet with baseline eukaryotes, i.e., multicellular life.
6. The probe will intervene to make corrective changes to the planet's biosphere. Using viruses engineered by AI as germline gene transfer agents, the necessary genetic changes will be enforced by the probe. The probe will use its dispersal facility to spread the virus on the planet.
7. The viruses will introduce new genes into organism populations on the planet.
8. The probe will actively attempt to guide the development of organisms that are useful to humans, e.g., trees, corn, wheat, fish, and chickens.
9. The probe will actively aim to guide an organism's development to becoming genetically exceedingly similar to humans.
10. Once humans evolve on the planet and advance technologically, they will hopefully discover the probe and recover the cultural and scientific repositories.

## Guided Evolution Probe Components

2. Planetary monitoring and analysis
3. Virus design
4. Virus manufacturing
5. Virus dispersal
6. Bacteria dispersal
7. Eukaryote dispersal

9. Human knowledge repository

## Challenges
1. Can the probe survive and operate functionally for potentially millions of years? 
2. Will the probe possess enough resources to construct viruses for millions of years?
3. Can in situ resources be used from the planet?
4. How can the probe monitor changes in life across the entire planet?
5. How will it receive samples?
6. Will the probe be able to exert sufficient evolutionary pressure?
7. Will organisms gain resistance to gene drives?
