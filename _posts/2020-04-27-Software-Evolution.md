title: My Evolving Interest in Software
---

This is a really rough post! But, I think it gives me a good summary of how I've evolved.
I feel my interest in software, programming, information technology has gone through five distinct phases:

* middle school script kiddie
    * started when I installed Debian on parent's computer; they soon bought me my own computer
    * unhealthy obsession with Linux, FreeBSD, and other obscure operating systems like [AROS](https://aros.sourceforge.io/)
    * lots of superficial knowledge 
    * shell script doodles 
    * occasional use of Wireshark
    * little to no code being written
    * excessive time invested to thwarting web filters at school
    * primarily a user of tools

* high school computer networking, TI-84 BASIC, Pythonista
   * mainly created calculator programs to make math class easier
   * ocasionally tried to learn Java and gave up often
   * learned about Python and stuck with it
   * didn't really have any good mentors
   * learned a decent amount about how routers and the internet works through computer networking technician courses
   * continued using Linux, but didn't update my shell scripts as much

* early college stagnation
   * flirted with being a mathematician or electrical engineer
   * didn't really focus on internships enough as I should've
   * I should've invested more in learning how to code in high school

* late college and post college panic
   * worked as a course assistant and did some linux security module stuff which was really cool
   * didn't really focus on internships enough as I should've
   * wasted time trying to learn all these JavaScript frameworks e.g. Angular, React, Meteor, etc
   * the job finding panic

* industry life
   * job offer from IBM
   * mainframes and other specialized enterprise technologies oh my god! :O
   * primiarly a creator of tools
   * build systems and other gate-kept knowledge are often a blocker
   * code interviews are hard
   * moved to San Jose, California from Durham, North Carolina.

So, this leads me to my current step. I feel, working in industry, algorithms knowledge gets lost in translation.
I don't mean for this list to be exclusive.  It's more of an indication that working in the industry can be different from an academic environment.
It's absolutely true that over time, you can become a bit myopic. 

Here's my list of the 'script kiddie' and high school stuff I've been revisiting:
* pcap and Wireshark
* iptables (I wasn't writing iptables from scratch in middle school, but I did use other people's shell scripts to do so)
* linux administration things e.g. how to setup your own DNS server
* big idea: make things fun again! learning is faster when you're having fun

But, at the same time, I feel most of the undergrad things I'm revisiting are mostly algorithms.
Things like:

* [Generating permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Algorithms_to_generate_permutations)
* [How Hash tables work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)
* [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
* [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)
* [Union-find Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)
* [Subset Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)
* [Elitist Ant Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms#Elitist_Ant_System)
