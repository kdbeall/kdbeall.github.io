title: My Evolving Interest in Software and Information Technology
---

This post is a bit of a ramble. Hopefully someday I'll draw some cartoons to accompany it.

* the middle school script kiddie
    * started when I installed Debian on parent's computer; they soon bought me my own computer
    * unhealthy obsession with Linux, FreeBSD, and other obscure operating systems like [AROS](https://aros.sourceforge.io/)
    * lots of superficial knowledge 
    * shell script doodles 
    * occasional use of Wireshark
    * little to no code being written
    * excessive time invested to thwarting web filters at school
    * primarily a user of tools

* high school networking geek, TI-84 BASIC, Pythonista
   * mainly created calculator programs to make math class easier
   * ocasionally tried to learn Java and gave up often
   * learned about Python and stuck with it
   * didn't really have any strong mentors
   * learned a decent amount about how routers and the internet works through computer networking technician courses
   * continued using Linux but didn't update my shell scripts as much (played way too much Civ V, RuneScape, and other games on my gaming desktop)

* the early college stagnation
   * flirted with being a mathematician or electrical engineer
   * didn't really focus on internships enough as I should've
   * constant feeling that I should've invested more in learning how to code in high school

* late college and post college panic
   * worked as a course assistant and did some linux security module stuff which was really cool
   * senior design project was pretty fun!
   * invested a lot of time working on all these JavaScript frameworks e.g. Angular, Meteor, etc
   * found decent mentors during my senior design project and contributed to some open source projects e.g. Vespene, OpsMop (unfortunately they never took off)
   * the job finding panic

* industry life
   * job offer from IBM
   * specialized enterprise technologies
   * primiarly a creator of tools
   * build systems and other specialized knowledge are often a blocker
   * learned code interviews are hard
   * moved to San Jose, California from Durham, North Carolina.
   * more focused on learning how to use 'practical' technologies and tools e.g. Go, React, Docker, and Kubernetes
   * huge disconnect between actual work and interviewing skills
