---

Working as a software development professional is different than what you
expected in school. Over time, you can become a bit myopic.

### Simply Shameful
* [Reversing an array in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm#examples)
* [Generating permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Algorithms_to_generate_permutations)
* [How Hash tables work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

### Slightly Cringeworthy
* [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
* [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)
* [Union-find Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)
* [Subset Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)

### The CS 400 Stuff That Probably Doesn't Have Any Practical Value Beyond Academia
* [Elitist Ant Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms#Elitist_Ant_System)
