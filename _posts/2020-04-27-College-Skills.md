title: Draft Post - How my interest in the software world has evolved
---

I feel my interest in software, programming, information technology has gone through four distinct phases:

* Middle School Script Kiddle
    * started when I installed Debian on parent's computer; they soon bought me my own computer
    * unhealthy obsession with Linux, FreeBSD, and other obscure operationg systems like [AROS](https://aros.sourceforge.io/)
    * lots of superficial knowledge 
    * shell script doodles 
    * occasional use of Wireshark
    * little to no code being written
    * excessive time invested to thwarting web filters at school
    * primarily a user of tools

* High School networking, TI-84 BASIC, Pythonista
   * mainly created calculator programs to make math class easier
   * ocasionally tried to learn Java and gave up often
   * learned about Python and stuck with it
   * didn't really have any good mentors
   * learned a decent amount about networking and how the internet works

* Early college stagnation
   * flirted with being a mathematician or electrical engineer
   * didn't really focus on internships enough as I should've
   * fuck I should've invested more in learning how to code in high school

* Late and post college panic
   * working as a course assistant and doing some linux security module stuff was really cool
   * didn't really focus on internships enough as I should've
   * let's try and learn all these JavaScript frameworks e.g. Angular, React, Meteor, etc
   * what the hell is a MongoDB?

* Industry life
   * wew job offer from IBM
   * mainframe wtf :O !?!?!

So, this leads me to my current step. I feel, working in industry, algorithms knowledge gets lost in translation.
I don't mean for this list to be exclusive.  It's more of an indication that working in the industry can be different from an academic environment.
It's absolutely true that over time, you can become a bit myopic. 

Here's my list of the 'script kiddie' stuff I've been revisiting:
* pcap and Wireshark
* iptables (okay, I wasn't writing iptables from scratch in middle school, but I did use other people's shell scripts to do so)
* big idea: make things fun again! learning is faster when you're having fun

Here's my list of high school things:
* basic 

Here's my list of the undergrad things I've been revisiting:

### Maybe Embarrassing
* [Reversing an array in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm#examples)
* [Generating permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Algorithms_to_generate_permutations)
* [How Hash tables work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)

### Slightly Cringeworthy
* [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
* [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort)
* [Union-find Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)
* [Subset Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)

### The CS 400 Stuff That Probably Doesn't Have Any Practical Value Beyond Academia
* [Elitist Ant Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms#Elitist_Ant_System)
