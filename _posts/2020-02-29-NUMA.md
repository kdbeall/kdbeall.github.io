title: Draft Post - NUMA and Other Fun Facts about CPU Topology
---

### TODO
I've been meaning to get around this for quite some time.

Meaning to add blurbs about 90s investigations into ccNUMA 
* the ill-fated (from a business perspective) ccNUMA projects at SGI
* IBM's acquisition of Sequent

### Introduction
NUMA stands for non-uniform memory acccess.
Key point: the cost of memory access is not uniform!

### CPU Topology

### Cache-coherence Protocols
